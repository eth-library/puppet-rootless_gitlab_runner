# Contributing

This document covers how to contribute to this module: setting up the development
environment, running the checks, the layout of the code, and how changes are reviewed,
merged and deployed. Consuming and operating the module on a host is covered by the
[README](README.md).

## Development toolchain

`rootless_gitlab_runner` is a Puppet module that installs and manages a rootless
GitLab Runner host; the [README](README.md) describes what it does in operation. The
code consists of Puppet manifests and EPP templates. The tooling around it comes from
the Ruby ecosystem, because Puppet is written in Ruby: the `puppet` CLI validates
syntax, `puppet-lint` enforces style, and `rspec-puppet` runs the unit tests, all
installed by Bundler at the versions pinned in `Gemfile.lock`. A Nix dev shell
provides the remaining tools (Ruby, yamllint, just) at the versions pinned in
`flake.lock`, and the `justfile` defines the check commands, so the same checks run
identically on every machine and in CI. The table below groups each tool by role; every
one is explained again where it is used.

| Tool | Category | Purpose | How this module uses it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Puppet** [\[1\]](#ref-1) | Configuration management | Declarative configuration management: you describe the target state, Puppet converges a host to it | `manifests/*.pp` hold the module logic; the `puppet` CLI also syntax-checks manifests and templates |
| **EPP** [\[2\]](#ref-2) | Templating | Puppet's templating language | `templates/*.epp` render the runner config and the systemd units |
| **Hiera** [\[3\]](#ref-3) | Data lookup | Puppet's hierarchical data lookup, keeping data out of code | consumers feed the module host data as Hiera keys; the class parameters in `init.pp` are that contract |
| **Ruby** [\[13\]](#ref-13) | Language runtime | The programming language Puppet and its tooling are written in | the dev shell provides Ruby 3.3; every Ruby tool below runs on it |
| **Bundler** [\[4\]](#ref-4) | Dependency management | Ruby's dependency manager | `Gemfile` declares the Ruby tools, `Gemfile.lock` pins their exact versions, `bundle exec <tool>` runs them |
| **rspec-puppet** [\[5\]](#ref-5) | Testing | Unit-test framework for Puppet modules | compiles the class and asserts on the result (see [Testing](#testing)) |
| **puppet-lint** [\[6\]](#ref-6) | Linting | Linter enforcing the Puppet style guide [\[7\]](#ref-7) | `just lint puppet`; options in `.puppet-lint.rc` |
| **yamllint** [\[8\]](#ref-8) | Linting | YAML linter | `just lint yaml`; rules in `.yamllint` |
| **shellcheck** [\[22\]](#ref-22) | Linting | Shell-script linter | the unit suite pipes the two rendered shell scripts through it (see [Testing](#testing)) |
| **nixfmt** [\[17\]](#ref-17) | Formatting | Formatter for the Nix language, run across the repository by treefmt | `just lint nix` fails when `flake.nix` is unformatted; `nix fmt` applies the formatting |
| **Nix flakes** [\[9\]](#ref-9) | Environment management | Reproducible package manager; a *flake* pins a complete environment to exact versions | `flake.nix` defines the dev shell, `flake.lock` pins it |
| **direnv** [\[10\]](#ref-10) | Environment management | Loads a per-directory environment automatically | `.envrc` enters the dev shell whenever you `cd` into the repository |
| **just** [\[11\]](#ref-11) | Task automation | A command runner: named recipes for a project's commands | the `justfile` is the single definition of the check gate |
| **GitHub Actions** [\[12\]](#ref-12) | Continuous integration | GitHub's CI/CD system | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same recipes on pull requests and `main` |

Two lockfiles pin every tool version: `flake.lock` (the environment: Ruby, yamllint,
just) and `Gemfile.lock` (the Ruby tools: puppet, puppet-lint, rspec-puppet). CI enters
the same dev shell and runs the same `just` recipes, split across three independent
jobs (see [CI/CD](#cicd)); the shared lockfiles prevent version drift between CI and
local development environments.

## Development environment

Two supported paths. The Nix path is recommended: it installs nothing globally and
cannot drift from CI. The manual path installs a few tools by hand and then runs the
identical commands.

### With Nix (recommended)

> [!TIP]
> **Using the Nix shell for development is strongly recommended**, for a few reasons: it pins
> the entire toolchain — Ruby, Puppet, the linters and `just` — to exact versions in
> `flake.lock`; every contributor and the CI/CD pipeline then run the same; and it
> activates the git pre-commit hook automatically.

**Prerequisite:** Nix is installed and the `nix-command` and `flakes` features are
enabled. See [Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) and the flakes
documentation [\[9\]](#ref-9) for how.

**Step 1, enter the dev shell.** Two ways:

- With direnv [\[10\]](#ref-10): run `direnv allow` once. Afterwards the shell loads
  automatically whenever the repository directory is entered; `nix develop` is never run
  manually.

  ```
  direnv allow
  ```

- Without direnv: enter the shell manually, in each terminal session:

  ```
  nix develop
  ```

The first entry downloads the toolchain pinned by `flake.lock`; later entries reuse
it. On entry the shell prints the tool versions and locations and the available
`just` commands:

![Entering the dev shell: the banner, the tool versions and locations, and the available just commands](assets/dev-shell.gif)

The recording is illustrative — the pinned versions move on; the printout on a real
entry is authoritative.
<!-- To re-record assets/dev-shell.gif after the banner or the `just` command
     list changes, run the hidden `just record-demo` recipe. -->

**Step 2, install the Ruby tools.**

```
just install
```

`just install` runs `bundle install`, which installs the gem versions pinned by
`Gemfile.lock` (puppet, puppet-lint, rspec-puppet and their dependencies) into
`vendor/bundle/` inside the repository; nothing is installed globally. This is needed
once after cloning, and again after every `Gemfile.lock` change.

### Without Nix

The Nix path above is the simplest and most reliable way to a working environment. The
manual path is a fallback and needs more steps: everything the Nix development shell provides
— Ruby, the linters, `just` — is installed by hand, and some of the Ruby test tools
additionally compile native extensions that need a system build environment.

Install by hand what the Nix development shell would have provided. Each linked reference
covers its own installation; match the versions `flake.lock` pins where it matters:

1. **A supported Ruby with Bundler** [\[13\]](#ref-13). The module is tested on **Ruby 3.3**
   (the version the Nix shell pins); the Gemfile constrains `>= 3.3.0, < 3.4.0`, so
   `bundle install` fails fast on other versions. Bundler ships with Ruby.
2. **A C build environment**, so `bundle install` can compile the native-extension gems in
   the bundle — such as `fiddle` [\[24\]](#ref-24) (a `libffi` [\[25\]](#ref-25) wrapper,
   pulled in transitively). This is standard for Ruby gems with C extensions and the packages
   vary by OS, so rather than reproduce a per-OS list here, install what the platform needs
   from ruby-build's "Suggested build environment" [\[23\]](#ref-23), which covers the
   compiler and libraries across macOS, Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and more.
3. **yamllint** [\[8\]](#ref-8): the YAML linter (`just lint yaml`).
4. **shellcheck** [\[22\]](#ref-22): the unit suite lints the module's rendered shell scripts
   with it.
5. **just** [\[11\]](#ref-11), strongly recommended — packaged for most platforms
   [\[14\]](#ref-14). The recipes are the intended way to run the gate, though each is a thin
   wrapper around plain commands (see the [`justfile`](justfile)) that can be run directly.

Then `just install` from the repository root (without just:
`bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle && bundle install`). puppet, puppet-lint
and rspec-puppet come from `Gemfile.lock` via Bundler, exactly as on the Nix path.

One check does not run on this path: the Nix format check (`just lint nix`) needs treefmt
from the Nix development shell, so `just check` skips it here with a notice. CI and commits
made from the Nix development shell still run it.

### Verify the setup

Run the full gate by executing:

```
just check
```

On a healthy setup every step passes and the run exits 0. With the tools above installed, no
step should be skipped.

## Command reference

The [`justfile`](justfile) is the single definition of the project's commands. Bare
`just` lists the recipes:

| Recipe | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just check` | **runs every check below, in order**: `validate`, the linters, `test`, plus a [`REFERENCE.md`](REFERENCE.md) freshness check. The full local gate; run it before pushing |
| `just docs` | regenerates [`REFERENCE.md`](REFERENCE.md) from the manifests' puppet-strings (`@param`) docs — run it after changing parameters; `just check` fails when it is stale |
| `just install` | `bundle install`: the Ruby tools from [`Gemfile.lock`](Gemfile.lock), into `vendor/bundle` |
| `just lint` | every `lint` target below |
| `just lint metadata` | `metadata-json-lint` on [`metadata.json`](metadata.json): schema, name pattern, SPDX license, dependency ranges |
| `just lint nix` | checks the repository's Nix files are formatted (treefmt + nixfmt). A failure reformats them in place: review and stage the result. `nix fmt` applies the same formatting on demand |
| `just lint puppet` | `puppet-lint` on the manifests: style and correctness. Warnings fail too ([`.puppet-lint.rc`](.puppet-lint.rc)) |
| `just lint yaml` | `yamllint` across the repository's YAML |
| `just test` | fetches the fixture modules pinned in [`.fixtures.yml`](.fixtures.yml) (apt, stdlib), then runs the rspec-puppet unit tests (see [Testing](#testing)) |
| `just validate` | `puppet parser validate` on every manifest and `puppet epp validate` on every template: pure syntax checks, nothing is applied to any host |
| `just _docs-check` | private (hidden from `just --list`); the [`REFERENCE.md`](REFERENCE.md) freshness check — regenerates to a temp file and diffs it against the committed one. Run by `just check` and CI |
| `just _fixtures` | private (hidden from `just --list`); fetches the spec fixture modules pinned in [`.fixtures.yml`](.fixtures.yml). Run by `just test` (and CI's `puppet-unit` job) before rspec |

CI runs these same recipes, but not via `just check`: each of the three pipeline jobs
runs its own slice independently (see [CI/CD](#cicd)). Together the jobs cover exactly
what `just check` covers.

A git **pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs `just check` before every
commit — the gate is fast enough that nothing is skipped. Entering the dev shell activates it
automatically (the flake shellHook sets
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`); on the without-Nix path, run that `git config`
command once yourself. Committing from outside the dev shell still works: the hook
falls back to `nix develop --command just check`. Skip it for a single commit with
`git commit --no-verify` — CI runs the same checks regardless. The hook unsets the
`GIT_*` environment git exports to hooks, so its nested git operations (the spec-fixture
clones) stay safe in a fresh git worktree.

## How the module is put together

One public class, `rootless_gitlab_runner` (in `manifests/init.pp`), declares every
parameter and contains seven private classes, one per concern, in a fixed order:
apt repositories, packages, user, rootless-docker bring-up, config, service,
self-update. Data flows one
way: the consumer's Hiera data binds to the class parameters, `init.pp` derives shared
values (runtime paths, the exec environment contract), and the private classes render
templates and declare resources from them. Private classes refuse direct inclusion;
the public class is the only entry point.

```

The module keeps its **dependency surface deliberately small**: built-in Puppet
resource types wherever possible, plus two Forge modules — `puppetlabs/stdlib`
(the `assert_private()` guard in the internal classes) and `puppetlabs/apt` (the
apt sources behind `packages.sources.manage`).

### Walkthrough: adding a configuration option

As a practical example, exposing a new `config.toml` key:

1. **`templates/config.toml.epp`**: render the key from the runner hash.
2. **`manifests/init.pp`**: document it in the `runners` `@param` list (the class
   parameters are the module's public API; their doc comments are the API docs).
3. **`spec/classes/rootless_gitlab_runner_spec.rb`**: assert the rendered line, and
   update `spec/fixtures/golden/config.toml.golden` to the new expected output. The
   golden file is updated by hand, deliberately: its diff is the review surface for
   template changes, so never regenerate it unseen.
4. **`README.md`**: only if the consumer-facing contract changed (new Hiera key,
   changed default).
5. Run `just check` to run all checks before you commit.

## Testing

The unit tests are rspec-puppet [\[5\]](#ref-5): each example compiles the class, with
a given set of parameters on the supported OS, into a *catalog* (Puppet's resolved
list of resources) and asserts on it. No host is involved; a test failure means the
module would have declared the wrong state. The suite covers the parameter guards (the
fail-loud cases), the resources behind each `manage` toggle, and the service
posture.

A few pieces are worth knowing beyond the plain parameter-and-guard examples:

- **Fixtures:** `just test` first runs `puppet-fixtures install`, which fetches the
  module dependencies pinned in [`.fixtures.yml`](.fixtures.yml) (apt, stdlib) into
  `spec/fixtures/modules/` and symlinks this module in beside them, so rspec-puppet can
  compile catalogs that `include apt`. The fetched fixtures are gitignored; the pins in
  `.fixtures.yml` are the source of truth.
- **Golden-file tests:** Rather than assert on fragments, these render an artifact in
  full and compare it byte for byte against a committed expected file under
  `spec/fixtures/golden/`: `config.toml` for a two-runner scenario, and the two rendered
  shell scripts (the apply and healthcheck scripts). Any template change surfaces as a
  diff in the golden — that diff is the review surface, and the golden is updated by hand
  on purpose (see the [walkthrough](#walkthrough-adding-a-configuration-option)). The two
  shell scripts are additionally piped through `shellcheck`; that check is skipped only
  when `shellcheck` is not on `PATH` (it is in the dev shell and in CI).
- **Data-versus-surface check:** `spec/unit/` exercises `scripts/check_hiera_data.rb` — the
  check a consumer control repository wires into its CI (see the README's
  [Validating Hiera data in CI](README.md#validating-hiera-data-in-ci)) — against fixture
  control-repository layouts under `spec/fixtures/data_check/`, including the stray-key shape
  observed in a live consumer; each fixture is described in that directory's
  [README](spec/fixtures/data_check/README.md). A catalog example additionally holds every
  `rootless_gitlab_runner::` key under `examples/data/` to the declared parameter surface, so
  the shipped examples cannot drift. Both ride `just test`, and therefore `just check` and CI.
- **Facts:** Examples that need a compiled catalog use the supported OS's facts, derived
  from `metadata.json` via `on_supported_os` (rspec-puppet-facts), so the fact set tracks
  the module's declared platform support instead of a hand-kept hash.
- **Coverage:** After the suite, rspec-puppet prints a resource-coverage summary — how
  many of the declared resources the examples touched. It is informational, not a gate.

The pipeline is the only gate between a merged commit and the hosts that auto-deploy
it.

## Change workflow

Most changes flow through an issue (optional for a small, self-contained change) and a pull
request against `main`; changes that only touch documentation may go straight to `main` (see
[Branching strategy](#branching-strategy)). An issue captures *what and why*; a pull request
delivers *how*, verified.

### Issues

Issues are categorised by outcome, which also sets the eventual version bump (see
[Commit rules](#commit-rules)):

- **Bug** (`fix`) — rendered configuration or applied host state is wrong, or behaviour does not
  match the documentation.
- **Improvement** (`feat`) — a new parameter, toggle, or managed resource, or better behaviour on
  existing surface.
- **Refactor / internal** (`refactor` / `chore`) — no behaviour change: code health, tooling, CI,
  dependencies.
- **Docs** (`docs`) — documentation only.

**Security** and **breaking** changes are flags on any category — a `Security` label and a
Keep-a-Changelog `Security` entry, or the `!` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` [major rule](#breaking-changes) — not separate
categories.

An issue records what needs to change and why, and — when known — the acceptance criteria that
define done, filled in as far as the design is understood (a problem-first issue may add criteria
after investigation). An issue is resolved by one or more pull requests; a large change may span
several. Open one from the chooser — **Bug report** or **Change proposal**; a blank issue stays
available for anything that fits neither.

### Pull requests

- A pull request may stand alone (a small, self-contained change) or resolve an issue — link it
  with `Closes #X`, or `Part of #X` when it is one of several.
- Keep every change well scoped: one concern per pull request, one logical change per
  commit. A pull request that fixes a bug should not also refactor unrelated code.
- Code and tests move together: a change and the tests covering it belong in the same
  pull request (see [Testing](#testing)).
- Update the documentation the change touches: `@param` docs in `init.pp` for API
  changes, the README when the consumer-facing contract changes.
- Record consumer-facing changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`, in the same
  pull request (new parameters, changed behavior, fixes, dependency or platform changes).
  Internal-only changes (refactors, tests, CI) need no entry.
- Open the pull request against `main`; merging requires a green validation
  workflow (see [CI/CD](#cicd)).
- Every commit follows the [commit rules](#commit-rules) below.

## Branching strategy

Development is trunk-based [\[21\]](#ref-21): `main` is always releasable. Changes that touch module
code, templates, or configuration land through a short-lived topic branch and a pull request with a
green validation gate (see [CI/CD](#cicd)) — `main` is protected, with an admin bypass reserved for
the exception below. Changes that only touch documentation may be committed directly to `main`,
provided `just check` passes locally first.

- **Topic branches are short-lived** and named for the change with a Conventional-Commit
  type prefix — `feat/allowed-images`, `fix/apply-script-quoting`,
  `docs/contributing-releases`. Branch from the current `main`, open a pull request, merge
  on a green gate, delete the branch.
- **Releases tag `main` directly.** The default release path adds no long-lived branch: a
  release is a signed tag on a `main` commit (see [Releases](#releases)).
- **`release/<version>` branches are optional and rarely needed.** The tag-on-`main` flow
  covers releases without one; a release branch is warranted only in the uncommon case where
  a release must be staged apart from ongoing work — for example holding a version bump and
  CHANGELOG roll while other changes keep landing. It is short-lived and deleted once the tag
  is pushed.

## Commit rules

Repository-wide rules; they apply to every commit on every branch.

- **Commits must be signed** [\[15\]](#ref-15); the repository rejects unsigned
  commits. Signing is also a deployment gate: hosts running the standalone
  self-update loop verify the commit signature (`git verify-commit`) on the remote
  branch before applying it, so an unsigned commit could never deploy anyway.
- **Commit messages follow Conventional Commits** [\[16\]](#ref-16):
  `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`. Keep one logical change per commit. The type carries the
  change's meaning for a configuration module, and drives the version bump at release time
  (see [Releases](#releases)):
  - `feat`: a new parameter, toggle, or managed resource — a **minor** bump.
  - `fix`: a correction to rendered configuration or applied host state — a **patch** bump.
  - `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`: documentation, specs, no-behaviour-change
    restructuring, and tooling/CI/dependency housekeeping respectively — none drives a
    release on its own.

  Scopes track the private classes and templates (`config`, `service`, `self_update`,
  `apt_repos`, `user`, `rootless_docker`), e.g. `feat(config): render allowed_images`,
  `fix(self_update): quote checkout path in apply script`.
### Breaking changes

Breaking changes are marked explicitly: append `!` after the type/scope
(`feat(init)!: rename the runners key`) or add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer that names the break and
its migration. A breaking change is a **major** bump; what counts as breaking is defined in
[Releases](#releases).

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is consumer-facing: it follows Keep a Changelog [\[20\]](#ref-20), and its
per-version section is what the release workflow publishes verbatim as the GitHub Release
notes. Add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in the same pull request as the change it
describes; at release time that section is rolled into the new version (see
[Releases](#releases)).

**What earns an entry — consumer-visible changes only:**
- a new parameter, toggle, or Hiera key, or a change to an existing one;
- a change in a default, or in what the module manages;
- a fix in rendered configuration or applied host state;
- a new or dropped dependency, or a change in supported OS / Puppet range;
- a security-relevant change.

Put it under the right Keep a Changelog category — Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed,
Fixed, Security. Internal-only work earns no entry: refactors, tests, CI, and dev tooling.
Documentation changes usually don't either — the CHANGELOG tracks the module's behaviour and
interface, not its prose — but a substantial new piece of user-facing documentation (a guide,
a migration note) can warrant an **Added** entry.

**Style — write for an operator reading the release notes:**
- State what changed and, where it helps an operator, a concrete benefit or why it matters.
  One entry per user-visible change, a line or two at most.
- Lead with the change itself, not a meta-phrase like "Now supports…".
- Then stop. Cut vague or promotional justification, long rationale, how-to, and examples;
  those belong in the README.
- Don't overclaim: describe what the module actually does, not an outcome it can't
  guarantee. e.g. write "fetch tokens by name from an
  off-repository store", not "keep tokens out of git".
- Leave out implementation detail, such as file modes, exit codes, internal environment
  variables, or private class names.
- Write each entry as a single unwrapped line. It becomes the GitHub Release notes, where
  wrapped lines break mid-sentence.

## CI/CD

The GitHub Actions [\[12\]](#ref-12) workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the
validation jobs **on pull requests and on pushes to `main`** (and on demand from the
Actions tab). Every job installs Nix,
enters the committed dev shell, and runs its slice of the gate. Three independent
jobs, same recipes as local:

| Job | Runs (inside `nix develop`) |
|---|---|
| `puppet-validate` | `just install`, `just validate`, `just lint puppet`, `just lint metadata`, `just _docs-check` |

The toolchain comes from `flake.lock` and `Gemfile.lock` in both places, which
prevents version drift between CI and local development environments. Two caches keep
it fast: the Nix store (keyed on the Nix files plus `flake.lock`) and the installed gems
(keyed on `flake.lock` plus `Gemfile.lock`, so a Ruby-series bump re-installs cleanly
instead of restoring an ABI-mismatched [\[18\]](#ref-18) bundle).

The workflow runs least-privilege (`permissions: contents: read`, no persisted checkout
token), and its action versions are SHA-pinned. Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
keeps those pins, the Ruby gems, and the Nix flake inputs current, opening a grouped PR
per ecosystem each week that goes through the same gate as any other change.

These checks never touch a host; they validate code only, so they run on plain hosted
runners. Keeping them green is what makes protecting `main`, and therefore the
auto-deploy described in the README's
[Applying the configuration](README.md#applying-the-configuration), safe: a red check
is the last cheap place to catch a bad change before a host converges to it.

A per-pull-request workflow, `.github/workflows/environment-diff.yml`, lets a reviewer
see what a `flake.lock` bump actually does before approving it. Such a bump, most often
one of Dependabot's weekly ones, arrives as a single opaque hash change that can stand for
hundreds of upstream package updates, with nothing in the PR showing which tools of the
pinned environment move. The workflow builds the environment before and after the bump and
posts the package and version differences as one plain-language PR comment. It updates that
same comment on later pushes and says nothing when the environment is effectively unchanged.

A separate workflow, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, runs at release time rather than on
every change: a pushed `v*` tag triggers it to guard the tag against `metadata.json` and the
CHANGELOG, reuse the validation workflow above as its gate, and draft a GitHub Release for
a maintainer to publish (see [Releases](#releases)). It never creates, signs, or publishes
the tag.

## Releases

Versions follow Semantic Versioning [\[19\]](#ref-19), read for a configuration module: a
[**breaking change**](#breaking-changes) — one that can break a consumer's existing data or platform — is a
**major** bump. That includes, not exhaustively: renaming or removing a parameter or Hiera key,
changing a host-affecting default, dropping a supported Puppet, Ruby, or operating-system version,
and regressing the applied state of an existing supported configuration.
A new parameter, toggle, or managed resource is a **minor** bump; a correction to rendered
configuration or applied state is a **patch** bump.

The flow keeps a maintainer at both trust anchors — signing the tag and publishing the
release — while CI does the mechanical validation and drafting in between:

1. **Land the change on `main`** through a pull request, with its `CHANGELOG.md` entry under
   `## [Unreleased]` (see [Change workflow](#change-workflow) and
   [Commit rules](#commit-rules)).
2. **Roll the CHANGELOG and bump the version** in a short-lived pull request: rename
   `## [Unreleased]` to `## [<version>] - <date>` [\[20\]](#ref-20), open a fresh empty
   `## [Unreleased]`, and set `metadata.json` `version` to `<version>`. Merge it on a green
   gate.
3. **Push the signed tag.** On the merge commit, a maintainer pushes an annotated, signed
   `v<version>` tag (`main` requires signed commits; the standalone self-update loop verifies
   the signature before applying — see [Commit rules](#commit-rules)).
4. **CI drafts the Release.** The tag push triggers the release workflow (see
   [CI/CD](#cicd)), which guards the tag against `metadata.json` and the CHANGELOG, reuses
   the validation gate, and creates a **draft** GitHub Release titled `v<version>` with the
   matching CHANGELOG section as its notes. CI never creates, signs, or publishes the tag or
   the release.
5. **A maintainer publishes the draft** in the GitHub UI after a review — the publish click is
   the final confirmation.

Between releases, `metadata.json` `version` carries the next patch with an `-rc` suffix (for
example `1.0.1-rc` once `1.0.0` has shipped). Under trunk-based development `main` is always
releasable: the next version can be cut from any commit, so `main` is a standing release
candidate, which the `-rc` marks. It is a single static marker, not a numbered series of
release candidates.

**Forge publishing is not part of a release yet.** The first releases ship git-only (r10k
pins a commit or tag). Publishing to the Puppet Forge may be evaluated for a later version,
once the packaging path is exercised.
